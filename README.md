Solving the problems from [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

I use this as an excuse to test new things as I learn Elixir. I simply enjoy
solving the problems, I'm not looking for perfect solutions/implementations as
noted in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1467243576966983685)
from the Advent of Code creator.

## nix-shell for Elixir

Reproducible development environment for Elixir which relies on
[Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix), a purely functional and cross-platform
package manager.

Start with `nix-shell --pure`.
